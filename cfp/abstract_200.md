The talk is particularly useful for developers of Python applications which
does heavy computation with or without NumPy - for data science, research etc.

Python extensions allows for creation of high-performance applications, which
can compete with C or C++ based ones. There are more than one framework to
achieve this (for example, Cython, Pythran and Numba) with similar syntaxes but
different underlying implementations. The talk surveys the state of the art of
creating extensions and introduces Transonic
(https://transonic.readthedocs.io). Transonic is a pure-Python package acting
as a unifying front-end for writing extensions with the aim to enhance the
developer experience.
