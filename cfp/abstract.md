Python has matured enough to allow developers to write predominantly
pure-Python with some optimized code which can compete with compiled languages
such as C and C++. The talk presents the current state of the art in terms of
writing extensions, and introduces a new package called Transonic
(https://transonic.readthedocs.io).

Transonic is a pure-Python package and unifying front-end for popular packages
such as Cython, Pythran and Numba (possibly more in the future). This approach
simplifies the development experience and the portability of code. The project
is young but ambitious and open for feedback.
